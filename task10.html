      <h1 class="text"> Taj Mahal</h1>
      <p class="text"> The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb in India. It was built in the
        17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its chief architect was Ustad
        Ahmed Lahauri.

        The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It is widely thought as one of the most beautiful buildings
        in the world. It is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.

        The Taj Mahal is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with the Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away. It
        was listed as one of the 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. It is on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra.

        The building was originally white. Because of pollution, it is turning yellow. Sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere
        reacts with water molecules and becomes sulphuric acid, which slowly destroys the outer layer of the building.
